            <h3>Hello! I'm Eddie. Welcome to my "about" page!</h3>
            <p>I've been working with HTML and CSS since August of 2021, and JS since October 2021. I especially enjoy playing around with CSS animations, and responsive page design. Figuring out creative solutions to problems is a lot of fun, I enjoy the challenge.</p>
            <p>I live alone with my cat Pico. Most of my day is spent drawing, animating, or gaming. I run a few creative hobby projects on the side, which involves communicating with other artists, writers, and community members from all across the globe.</p>
            <p>I'm always happy to learn new things, and utilizing my skills in creative ways. I pick up new things relatively quick, but especially if I am able to play around with it.</p>
